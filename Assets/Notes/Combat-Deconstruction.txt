Let's take apart the features of combat:

"Attack can be charged by holding a button down to increase the range,
size of the hitbox, and strength of the attack."

Attacks can be charged
Charging can be done by holding a button
Attacks have a visual range
Attacks have a hitbox
Attacks have a strength

QUESTIONS:
  1. Is a charge part of an attack or a pre-cursor to the attack?
  2. Is charging always done by holding a button?
  3. Is charging ended when the button is releaseed?
  4. Are these visual effect sizes always dynamic?
  5. What is the shape of the hitbox?
  6. Does the hitbox animate during the attack?
  7. What is the effect of strength in an attack?

"Basic attack on input and release <.2 seconds. Alternating punches which
apply hitstun and volatility but no knockback."

There is a basic Attack
Basic Attack is triggered when a button is held for less than .2 seconds.
Basic Attack applies hitstun
Basic Attack applies volatility
Basic Attack does not apply knockback
Basic Attack alternates between left and right hand attacks for each successive attack

QUESTIONS:
  1. What is hitstun?
  2. What does volatility do?
  3. What is knockback?
  4. Does alternation between swipes occur regardless of time between attacks?
  5. Can I do this forever to a target?

"Medium Attack on charge from .02-2 seconds. Applies knockback and more volatility."

There is a medium attack
Medium attack is triggered when key held for .2-2 seconds
Medium attack applies knockback
Medium attack applies volatility

QUESTIONS:
  1. Is the charging phase a precursor to various attacks?
  2. Is there a visual/audio indication when you enter the medium attack charging?
  4. Does medium attack apply hitstun?
  5. What does the medium attack look like?

"Heavy attack on charge of 2 seconds and up. Applies even more knockback and volatility."

There is a Heavy Attack
Heavy attack is triggered when key held for .2-2 seconds
Heavy attack applies knockback
Heavy attack applies volatility

QUESTIONS:
  1. Is there a visual state change when you enter heavy attack charging?
  3. Does heavy attack apply hitstun?
  4. What does heavy attack look like?

There seem to be a few data structures here:

  CharacterState
    Commands from its controller
    Physical Contact
    Status Effects
      HitStun
      Knockback
      Wallbounce

  CharacterActionState : CharacterState
    Bool CanCancel
    Bool CanHitstun 
    Bool CanKnockback
    Bool CanDamage
  
  ChargingState : CharacterActionState
